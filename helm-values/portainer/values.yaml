# Portainer BE Helm values managed by Argo CD.
# Chart: portainer/portainer
# Reference: https://docs.portainer.io/start/install/server/kubernetes/baremetal
#
# NOTE: The Helm chart has a bug where --trusted-origins values get wrapped in
# escaped double quotes, breaking CSRF validation. The install script patches
# the deployment args directly after Helm install. Argo CD will show a diff for
# the patched args — this is expected and should not be synced back.
